# Railway Deployment - BUILD ISSUES FIXED 

## üöÄ SOLUTION: Use Railway-Optimized Files

### Problem Identified
Railway builds were failing due to:
- Heavy AI dependencies timing out
- Complex database initialization 
- Large model files causing memory issues

### Solution: Minimal Deploy First

**Use these files for Railway deployment:**

1. **`Dockerfile.railway`** - Lightweight, fast build
2. **`requirements.railway.txt`** - Minimal dependencies
3. **`railway-entrypoint.sh`** - Simplified startup
4. **Simplified `main.py`** - Already configured

### Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Railway Dashboard**: Connect this repository
2. **Build Settings**: Select `Dockerfile.railway`  
3. **Auto Deploy**: Railway will build in ~2 minutes
4. **Public Access**: Get instant URL

## üìã Deployment Files

- `Dockerfile.deploy` - Production Docker configuration with model download
- `docker-compose.deploy.yml` - Railway service configuration  
- `download_models.py` - Model setup script for production deployment

## üîß Railway Setup Steps

1. **Sign up at Railway.app**
   ```
   https://railway.app
   ```

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo" 
   - Select your Text-morph repository
   - Choose the `milestone2` branch

3. **Configure Build**
   - Railway will detect Dockerfile.deploy automatically
   - Build will take 5-10 minutes (downloading models + dependencies)
   - Both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 8501) will be exposed

4. **Access Your App**
   - Backend API: `https://your-app.railway.app:8000`
   - Frontend UI: `https://your-app.railway.app:8501` 
   - Full app will be publicly accessible worldwide
